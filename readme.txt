Place mod.ff and z_ms2.iwd in your Call of Duty 4/Mods/g13ftag/ - and set your fs_game to g13ftag
Your server startup line should be similar to this:

+set dedicated 2 +set fs_game mods/g13ftag +set net_ip xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx +set sv_maxclients 32 +set net_port 28960 +set sv_punkbuster 1 +exec server.cfg +map_rotate

There are many new configs added by the Openwarfare Team.  To simplify things we added the Spearhead config.  
Just copy and paste the setting you want to change into the spearhead config.  
The next time we update you will then have all your changed settings and wont have to worry about looking in all the configs again.  
You just make sure you exec spearhead.cfg last.
